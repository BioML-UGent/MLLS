        "- one to one: vanilla MLPs that map a fixed size 1-D vector to a 1-D vector for classification or regression\n",
        "- one to many: Image captioning, given an input embedding (obtained with a CNN), a textual caption of variable length is generated.\n",
        "- many to one: (1) Sentence classification such as sentiment analysis or (2) image generation from text: in both cases variable input texts are given as input and a fixed dimensional output is generated.\n",
        "- many to many: (1) machine translation of a variable-length sentence to another variable-length sentence or (2) transcription of a variable-length .mp3 audio to a variable length text.\n",
        "- many to many (1to1 correspondence): (1) Video classification: one label for a variable number of frames in the video (the video frame embedding can be obtained with a CNN and then input into a RNN), (2) autoregressive language modeling: trying to predict the next word in the sentence, for generative purposes or (3) word classification: classify every word as belonging to a category.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note that these settings are not exclusive to recurrent neural networks. In fact, any network type that works on variable input sequences can be used towards these ends. Most famously of which are of course, Transformers, which have all but replaced RNNs in NLP and many other fields. An explanation and implementation of transformers is out of the scope of this course. It suffices to know that RNNs process input sequence sequentially through memory cells, whereas transformers do it in parallel through an $n \\times n$ attention matrix. Other than RNNs and Transformers, convolutional networks can also be used on variable length inputs: a 1D kernel can equally well convolve over a sequence of length $100$ as $1000$. It is only because of the linear layers at the end for classification requiring a specific number of input nodes that typical CNNs become applicable on only one specific input size."

        "For every point in the timeseries, the *input token* consists of the value at that timepoint and, optionally, extra covariates pertaining to that timepoint. Conceptually, this is similar to the channels in a CNN, as there we also had input tokens (e.g. pixels) with multiple values (e.g. the 3 RGB values) per token. In our case, extra covariates could be for example the hour at which that timepoint was taken. This input sequence will go into the RNN, which will keep a hidden layer which acts as a memory bank. The memory bank of every input will consist of a combination of the information at that time point and the information coming in from the memory cell at the previous time point. The specific way this information is brought together depends on the specific construction of the RNN. We refer you to the theory lectures for details. The most popular constructions are the LSTM and the GRU memory cells. For every timestep, the model outputs a vector which (for this purpose) needs to be linearly recombined to one number as our goal is to predict the value of the next timestep (i.e. a regression task).\n",

        "\n",
        "**For RNN, another reason is that our \"actual\" neural network depth is essentially decided by our input length**, so if we send in a sample containing a thousand input tokens, we also backpropagate through a thousand layers, and our computers will surely crash. In addition, it is not reasonable to assume the number of cyclists hundreds of days past still influences the number of cyclists now. So, the problem of batching our sequence becomes one of weighing two factors: how long of a sequence can our model handle, and how much context (in number of preceding tokens) do our models need for prediction?\n",
